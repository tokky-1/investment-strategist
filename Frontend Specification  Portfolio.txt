Example text:
"Over 1 year, this portfolio could fluctuate based on market conditions and FX rates."
5. Loading & UX States (Demo-Critical)
Mandatory loading messages: - "Analyzing your budget…" - "Fetching live US stock prices…" - "Gemini is
building your portfolio…"
These make the demo feel alive.
6. Error States
Frontend must handle: - API timeout - Invalid inputs - Empty portfolio response

Errors must be human-readable:
"We couldn’t fetch prices right now. Please try again."
